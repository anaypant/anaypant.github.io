## About me
I love :pizza: , reading WW2 :books: and watching WW2 :cinema: , working on :robot:

I founded [Make-a-bot](https://make-a-bot.wixsite.com/make-a-bot) to teach robotics and First Competition training to kids. 

I am currently working on AI projects - creating games to make AI concepts simpler to understand for kids.
