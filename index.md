# Hello world!

My name is Anay. I am a High School Freshman at [The Athenian School](https://www.athenian.org/) in California.  I have a passion for coding and robotics.

This site is a  collection of various techy things that I do.

## PyCon conference
I have been attending PyCon since 2017. I missed 2020 due to the pandemic. However I am eager to particpate and present in PyCon 2021 ! My poster titled "Creating and teaching games in Python to teach Artificial Intelligence concepts" has been accepted and I will present it virtually on May 16th, 2021. You can find out more at https://us.pycon.org/2021/

I have presented posters in PyCon 2018 and 2019. It is great fun and a nice way to meet other people interested in the same things as you are!

## Outreach & Teaching 
I started as a teaching assistant to my Mom in 7th grade (2018). My mother is a mentor and advisor to High School kids in Fremont as part of non-profit, https://www.fremontstem.org/ and founder of volunteer organisation [Pykids](https://pykids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). She leads summer workshops to introduce children to technology and maker projects. 

I took my cue from her and have participated as a Teaching Assistant in fremontstem and pykids since 6th grade. I have helped students with setting up their computers with Python and then assisting them during the class. Our classes were covered in the [Connected Science article in 2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqsp7_tP5brLlI3O-73acZslQwRWogNy/view?usp=sharing)

In 2018 and 2019, I worked as a Teaching Assistant in [ASDRP High School summer projects](https://www.asdrp.org/). We worked on fun projects such as creating DIY Christmas ornaments and EV3 robots.

I have presented these teaching experiences at PyCon as mentioned above. 

Since 2020, I have started doing Robotics and AI outreach - for details see below.


## Code Projects 
I have been learning some languages such as Python and Java. 

### Python projects

## AI 
For the past 3 years, I have taken Artificial Intelligence classes at https://aiclub.world/. AI is a buzz word - It is an exciting yet daunting subject. My instructor made these classes fun and less daunting by using real world examples and games. I got so inspired, I started understanding and writing neural networks in Python in no time. Now, I am trying to create the same experience for my students.

### AI Outreach & Teaching
I am a volunteer teacher and I teach AI concepts to students in 6th - 12th grade. When I create a course, I think of how to include AI concepts in games. I write games utilizing libraries like turtle and pygame. I consult with my instructor and they help review my courses.

Here are some examples of my curriculum:

* [Stock Predictor using AI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HbtudvKDDbJNVzORYFK-6QyyY7YT7-r1OoEZtTZoVg0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Robotics
I have been learning Robotics since Kindergarden. I started with Lego Robotics and then went on to work on EV3. Then in 2018, my schoolmates and I created a team called Ninjabots and we entered into our first competition. Since then we have competed every year. Our team website is available here [https://ninjabotsfll.wixsite.com/ninjabots ](https://ninjabotsfll.wixsite.com/ninjabots)
 
 In 2021 we are partcipating in the FTC https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc challege. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQtZhcgSpx8&t=1047s) describes our design.
* We completed our first qualifier on March 14th, 2021 - [This is our highest scoring run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R9KdUW_RYI)
* We want to better, so we are preparing for our second qualifier on April 10th,2021 - Stay tuned!
 
### Code

### Video links
 * I do both mechanical design and programming of the robot. Click [here](https://youtu.be/ShfYy1rA5pk) for a video where I explain our FLL 2020 robot design!

### Robotics Outreach & Teaching

#### 2021
I have launched my wesbite [https://make-a-bot.wixsite.com/make-a-bot](https://make-a-bot.wixsite.com/make-a-bot) I am conducting Wedo and Lego robotics classes this summer. Check it out!!

#### 2020
* In Jan and Feb 2020 , I mentored a Junior Lego team ( K-2) for the Google "Boomtown Build Challenge". I wrote about it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRA5rBMGZTV6IdMDHKYbWZOJIrbFAJSPLY1TYkFJ-i8/edit?usp=sharing) 
* Then in summer 2020, I conducted a camp in which students (3-6 grades) learnt about robotics and how to participate in First lego league! 
  * I adverstised this camp on hangouts on local Nextdoor. The flyer is available [here](https://anaypant212.wixsite.com/fllsummercamp) 
  * [Here]() is a video of my first class of teaching students!
