# Hello world!

My name is Anay. I am a High School student at [The Athenian School](https://www.athenian.org/) in California.  I have a passion for coding and robotics.

This site is a  collection of various techy things that I do.

## PyCon conference
I have been attending PyCon since 2017. I missed 2020 due to the pandemic but I did present virtually ( while recovering from appedicitis in hospital!!)  on May 16th, 2021.  [PyCon poster session presented on hublio. Viewed by 20+ visitors ](https://pyconus2021.hubilo.com/)

I also got an oppotunity to present this submission as a talk in PyOhio 2021 [PyOhio lightning talk - Creating and Teaching Games in Python to teach Artificial Intelligence Concepts to 6-12 graders](https://www.pyohio.org/2021/program/talks/creating-and-teaching-games-in-python-to-teach-artificial-intelligence-concepts)

I have presented posters in PyCon 2018 and 2019. It is great fun and a nice way to meet other people interested in the same things as you are! Thank you PyCon for providing me financial aid each year to attend and present!

## Outreach & Teaching 
I started as a teaching assistant to my Mom in 7th grade (2018). My mother is a mentor and advisor to High School kids in Fremont as part of non-profit, https://www.fremontstem.org/ and founder of volunteer organisation [Pykids](https://pykids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). She leads summer workshops to introduce children to technology and maker projects. 

I took my cue from her and have participated as a Teaching Assistant in fremontstem and pykids since 6th grade. I have helped students with setting up their computers with Python and then assisting them during the class. Our classes were covered in the [Connected Science article in 2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqsp7_tP5brLlI3O-73acZslQwRWogNy/view?usp=sharing)

In 2018 and 2019, I worked as a Teaching Assistant in [ASDRP High School summer projects](https://www.asdrp.org/). We worked on fun projects such as creating DIY Christmas ornaments and EV3 robots.

I have presented these teaching experiences at PyCon as mentioned above. 

Since 2020, I have started doing Robotics and AI outreach - for details see below.


## Code Projects 
I have been learning some languages such as Python and Java. 

### Python projects 
* [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1phUlpH7skkfB7BKbbKWHfrC9CIJ_36PQ6fyGe1FCwMQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a write-up on my programming projects.

## AI 
For the past 4 years, I have taken Artificial Intelligence classes at https://aiclub.world/. AI is a buzz word - It is an exciting yet daunting subject. My instructor made these classes fun and less daunting by using real world examples and games. I got so inspired, I started understanding and writing neural networks in Python in no time. Since 2020, I work as an intern in AIClub and I try to create the same experience for my 6-12 grade students.

### Classes
#### 2022
* Intern at [AI Club](https://www.corp.aiclub.world/)
#### 2021
* AI Scholars program at [Inspirit AI](https://www.inspiritai.com/) - August Cohort
* On June 27th, I presented my work "Custom Nutrition via AI Recommendations" with the [EatRight app](https://medium.com/@anaypant212/an-app-to-give-food-recommendations-using-an-ai-with-python-dcd30dc37048) in [AIClub Student Research Symposium](https://www.corp.aiclub.world/2021-student-research-symposium?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=123569691&_hsenc=p2ANqtzjK2JHRjS7O6v5Zb2qK8MDf6oHuDqXsVHHrc09cZajRQHTsJgcDWkAlfk2_AlTS4wUi9H_VoIwYZH8lGF5iQzp_BYD7A&utm_content=123569691&utm_source=hs_email)
* Summer Internship at [AI Club](https://www.corp.aiclub.world/)

#### 2020
* Currently I am working on the [EatRight app](https://medium.com/@anaypant212/an-app-to-give-food-recommendations-using-an-ai-with-python-dcd30dc37048) I have made an application that can recommend food to any user but with a twist: In my app, the most unique function is that the app personalizes the dataset for each user!
* I blogged about [Linear Regression](https://medium.com/@anaypant212/linear-regression-using-scholastic-gradient-descent-in-python-bed6b07a38de) that I learnt last year 
* Python with AI class 
  * Presentation video: https://youtu.be/QMoUwgl0cDk

### AI Outreach & Teaching
I am a volunteer teacher and I teach AI concepts to students in 6th - 12th grade through [AI Club](https://www.corp.aiclub.world/). When I create a course, I think of how to include AI concepts in games. I write games utilizing libraries like turtle and pygame. I consult with my instructor and they help review my courses.

Here are some examples of my curriculum:

* [A Cheat Sheet I made for Students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTM4zhnyI6ZvvGffhJ6tJTJnfBGc_Hwn5Rc_3oTwOSM/edit?usp=sharing)
* [TicTacToe using AI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aUIV6jAahnLCWUlGNwtWbg4ew6Q0afl3aSMgEVAaIkE/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Stock Predictor using AI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HbtudvKDDbJNVzORYFK-6QyyY7YT7-r1OoEZtTZoVg0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Robotics
I have been learning Robotics since Kindergarden. I started with Lego Robotics and then went on to work on EV3. Then in 2018, my schoolmates and I created a team called Ninjabots and we entered into our first competition. Since then we have competed every year. Our team website is available here [https://ninjabotsfll.wixsite.com/ninjabots ](https://ninjabotsfll.wixsite.com/ninjabots)

I am the Head of the Programming, and assists the Mechanical Team if needed [Ninjabots team](https://ninjabotsfll.wixsite.com/ninjabots/about-2)
I also particpate in [Athenian Robotics Club](https://www.athenian-robotics.org/) and in the FRC competitions.
### Code

### Robotics Outreach & Teaching

#### 2021 - 2022
I founded and launched "Makeabot LLC"  [https://make-a-bot.wixsite.com/make-a-bot](https://make-a-bot.wixsite.com/make-a-bot) to teach Wedo and Lego robotics classes in summer 2021. My plan is to continue this venture in 2022
* Post the success of the [FLL summer camps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mF0uoyMDxQfux0aRXnJjfWKKwbNYgEgON5QJnQxCdmQ/edit?usp=sharing), Makeabot got hired to mentor two teams (FLL , FLL Junior) for 2021-22 season. 
* I managed the service agreement, curriculum, finances and coordinated rotations with my team. The profits (~2000 USD) from this job went into funding our FTC partcipation costs!.  
* You can read about our mentoring experience [here](https://ninjabotsfll.wixsite.com/ninjabots)

#### 2020
* In Jan and Feb 2020 , I mentored a Junior Lego team ( K-2) for the Google "Boomtown Build Challenge". I wrote about it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRA5rBMGZTV6IdMDHKYbWZOJIrbFAJSPLY1TYkFJ-i8/edit?usp=sharing) 
* Then in summer 2020, I conducted a camp in which students (3-6 grades) learnt about robotics and how to participate in First lego league! 
  * I adverstised this camp on hangouts on local Nextdoor. The flyer is available [here](https://anaypant212.wixsite.com/fllsummercamp) 
  * [Here]() is a video of my first class of teaching students!
